Seaborn
Seaborn is a statistical infographics library, which builds on the capabilities of Matplotlib. Seaborn
was designed to augment Matplotlib’s functions and tools, addressing some of the common issues
users have with Matplotlib, with the goal of making the creation of useful, aesthetically pleasing
visualizations quicker and easier.
Matplotlib’s interface is fairly low-level and as a result the user often needs to write a fair amount
of boilerplate code. Seaborn attempts to reduce much of the redundancy in Matplotlib and make the
more difficult Matplotlib visualization tasks easier.
In this chapter, we’ll go over the features of Seaborn, discuss the process of creating and styling plots
with Seaborn, and then look at some sample visualizations produced with it.
Features of Seaborn
There are some notable features of Seaborn that make many people’s preferred plotting choice, over
pure Matplotlib. Seaborn allows the user to create statistical graphics easily thanks to features like:
a high-level interface, aesthetically pleasing themes, easy comparison between multiple variables,
multi-plot grids, univariate and bivariate visualization, automatic estimation for regressions, and
easy plotting of time series data.
Compared to Matplotlib, Seaborn’s API is a much higher-level API, meaning that it takes fewer
lines of code to produce visualizations with Seaborn. Matplotlib’s basic visualizations are also rather
sparse, while Seaborn’s visualizations are stylized and they are customizable with premade themes.
Seaborn allows the user to easily compare multiple variables thanks to the fact that the API is based
around datasets, negating the need to manually select columns and rows to compare variables. With
Seaborn, most plots can be created simply by choosing a plotting function, passing in the dataset
you are using, and then specifying columns.
Seaborn supports the creation of multi-plot grids, which allows the user to create complex visualizations with different types of plots. Seaborn also facilitates the comparison of subsets of a dataset by
creating univariate and bivariate plots.
Seaborn also automatically handles common plotting tasks. For instance, it will automatically create
regression lines for scatter plots and interprets time series data
